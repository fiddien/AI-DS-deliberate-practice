In the introductory course to Python, we provided information to our scripts by creating variables and passing parameters to our functions with the values that we wanted. 
This works fine for small scripts, but it's usually not ideal for larger jobs. When processing large chunks of data, it's a good idea to read that data from files. 
In programming, we work with files all the time. 
It's such a useful task that most programming languages have the ability to work with files baked into the core set of features. Python is no exception. 
It gives us file objects which we can use to read and write to files. To open a file on a computer called spider.txt, we can write this code.
