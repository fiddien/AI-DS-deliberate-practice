## Types of programming

-   procedural: **how**
    1.  please, open the door
    2.  go outside
    3.  take the bucket
    4.  bring it back to me
-   declarative: **what**
    -   fetch the bucket, please
-   functional
-   object-oriented

SQL is a declarative programming language

-   Data Definition Language
    
    creation of data
    
    -   CREATE statement
    -   ALTER statement
    -   DROP statement
    -   RENAME statement
    -   TRUNCATE statement
-   Data Manipulation
    
    manipulation of data
    
    -   SELECT ... FROM ...
    -   INSERT INTO ... VALUES ...
    -   UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...
    -   DELETE FROM .. WHERE ...
-   Data Control
    
    assignment and removal of permissions to use this data
    
    -   GRANT ... ON ... TO ...
    -   REVOKE ... ON ... FROM ...
-   Transaction Control
    
    saving and restoring changes to a database
    
    -   COMMIT
        -   INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE
        -   saves the transaction in the database
        -   changes cannot be undone
    -   ROLLBACK
        -   allows you to take a step back
        -   the last change(s) made will not count

## Database

-   relational
    -   compact, well-structured, efficient
    -   main goal: organize huge amounts of data that can be retrieved quickly
    -   relational algebra
-   non-relational

primary key

- a column whose value exists and is unique for every record in a table
- each table can only have one primary key
- cannot contain null values
- the primary key is always underlined in relational schema

foreign key
- identifies the relationships between table, not the tables themselves
- in relational schema, the source of the arrow usually indicates the foreign key that are primary key to another table

unique key
- used whenever you would like to specify that you don't want to see duplicate data in a given field
- can have null values

## Relationships

tell how much of the data from a foreign key field can be seen in the primary key column of the table the data is related to and vice versa

### Relational schemas

-   represent the concept database administrators must implement
-   depict how a database is organized
-   blueprints, or a plan for a database
-   will help immensely while writing queries
