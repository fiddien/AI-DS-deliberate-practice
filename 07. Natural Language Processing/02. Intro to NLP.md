# Intro to NLP
## Structured Languages
- Mathematics
	- y = 2x + 3
- Formal Logics
	- X is parent of Y
	- Z is parent of Y
	- then X and Z are siblings
- Computer codes
	``` sql
	SELECT name, email
	FROM users
	WHERE name LIKE 'A%'
	```

These languages are design to be unambiguous as possible, thus are suitable for computer to process.

## Unstructrud Languages
Human languages have grammar too. But for the most part, we deliver the sentences in ambiguous way, yet still managed to understand them effortlessly.

Computer can process these unstructured text in certain ways. Few named techniques:
- Keywords
- Parts of speech
- Named entities
- Dates & quantities


## NLP Pipelines
The simplified pipeline:
1. Text Processing
	- Why we need to process text?
		- the text sources format
2. Feature Extraction
	- creating representation of the words/letters/sentences
		- nodes
		- vectors
	- what is the end goal?
3. Modeling
	- using statistical techniques or machine learning
