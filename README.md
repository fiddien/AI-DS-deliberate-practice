# learn-deep-learning

A place to store notebooks when I'm first learning deep learning. A lot of them will be from MA4072 Pembelajaran Mendalam class which was held in 2020/2021 academic year, second semester.

Topics covered:
- Regression with neural network from stratch
- Neural network from stratch for stock prediction
- Recurrent Neural Network from stratch for stock prediction
- Stochastic Gradient Descent with Adam Optimizer from stratch for stock prediction
- Deep Learning with PyTorch Autograd for stock prediction
- Dictionary-based Twitter Sentiment Analysis on SNMPTN 2021 result
- N-gram prediction on Rhoma Irama's songs lyrics
- Reinforcement Learning with Q-Learning for robot movement path in ITB CAS Building 4th floor

All using Python with sometimes using framework like PyTorch and Tensorflow.

Some new concepts learned (but may not be shown in the notebooks):
- fundamental difference between machine learning and conventional programming
- fundamental difference between machine learning models and statistical models
- forward and backward propagation
- gradient descent optimizers
- computational graphs
- dynamic programming

To do:
[ ] upload Bangkit assignments (which is a lot!)

[ ] produce some articles my works here in my blog [ilmaaliyaf.github.com](https://ilmaaliyaf.github.com)
