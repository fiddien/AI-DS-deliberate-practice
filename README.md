# Learn AI & DS with Deliberate Practice

## Why learn Artificial Intelligence?


## Why lean Data Science?

## Why learn both AI and DS?

## What is deliberate practice?


1. designed to improve performance,
2. repeat things a lot,
3. need feedbacks continously,
4. mentally demanding, and ultimately
5. not fun.

So far, I have planned to learn (or re-learn) the following topics:
1. Fundamentals of AI
2. Machine Learning
3. Deep Learning
4. Computer Vision
5. Natural Language Processing
6. Reinforcement Learning
7.
